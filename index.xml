Not that that&amp;rsquo;s particularly unusual, but today was with a good reason: I&amp;rsquo;d promised my son to take him for a bike ride.
You see, he&amp;rsquo;s quite an active little fella who needs his daily dose of physical activity. And I&amp;rsquo;m happy to fix him up :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve always found that actually &lt;em>going somewhere&lt;/em> is much more interesting than &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; going for a ride.
It feels a lot less like training that way, haha.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead of riding around in a circle, I took my son to go see &lt;a href="https://www.anotheronebitesthedust.be/">Another One Bites The Dust&lt;/a> (AOBtD), an ultra race that was - and, at the time of writing, is still - being held in Bierbeek.
That&amp;rsquo;s at some 20 km from where we live, aka the perfect distance for a saturday morning round trip.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ultra-what" >Ultra what?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#ultra-what">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>According to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramarathon">Wikipedia&lt;/a>, an ultra running race is &amp;ldquo;any footrace longer than traditional marathon length of 42.195 km&amp;rdquo;.
Some races run over a certain distance (e.g. 50km, 100km, 100 miles), and others last for a predetermined time (e.g. 24 hour runs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Backyard / One More Loop type races are different: there is no predefined finish, either in distance nor time.
Instead, participants run a short loop (typically 6.7 km or 4.167 miles, to make for 100 miles in 24 hours) once every hour.
The last one standing wins, the others get DNF behind their names.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say it takes a special kind of special to even consider signing up for such a race.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fun fact: earlier, in May, a Belgian, Merijn Geerts, set a new world record: he ran 90 loops of 6.7km in Rettert, Germany.
That&amp;rsquo;s 603.5 km (!).
In almost 4 days (!!).
Without actual real sleep, other than the occasional 5-minute nap in between loops (!!!!😳)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other fun fact: that same Merijn Geerts won the past three editions of AOBtD.&lt;/p>

&lt;br>
So off we went on our bikes, to go superhero-spotting in Bierbeek. We arrived on the scene at around 10:35.
Just in time to see the runners returning from their 15th loop of 5.959 km, meaning they had just started their 3rd marathon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Atypical runners in an atypical race&lt;/strong> &lt;br>
I had expected to see sharp-as-a-knife athletes, well-equipped and looking serious and seriously tired.
And there were some of those, but they were definitely not the majority.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, most were walking, chatting and smiling (!). Some wore a backpack, others what looked like shorts you&amp;rsquo;d wear to the beach.
I saw only one runner with poles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And there were no bib numbers to be seen, they wore removable ankle bracelets for time registration instead.
I guess that makes changing shirts a lot more practical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br>
&lt;strong>friendly &amp;amp; no-nonsense&lt;/strong> &lt;br>
My son and I were welcomed by a friendly lady, who explained that there was no entry fee. They did have an &lt;em>honesty box&lt;/em> though, so we put in some
money and were told we could help ourselves to some drinks or food.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think we were the only actual supporters; the rest of the people were runners, their crew, or the race crew. But we didn&amp;rsquo;t feel out of place or unwelcome at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Not much going on, but so much to see&lt;/strong> &lt;br>
The summer heat was coming up, I heard distant screaming from kids on a bouncy castle. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember any music though.
A smoldering camp fire filled the air with the scent of summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We just sat down, had a drink and watched runners coming in. At ten to eleven, when the next loop would start, someone shouted &amp;ldquo;Ten Minutes!&amp;rdquo;. Then nothing for five minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At five to eleven (&amp;ldquo;Five Minutes!&amp;rdquo;) people started gathering at the gate, then progressively more as the start of the next hour and so the next loop approached.
Some runners were still coming in and didn&amp;rsquo;t even take the time to sit down.
Others took a chair to the start to sit and take naps until the last second, or were nibbling away a pack of salty crackers or candy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, 11 o&amp;rsquo;clock came, someone blew a horn, everyone clapped, the runners ran - or walked - through the gate, and the campsite was calm and peaceful once more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../another-one-bites-the-dust/2.jpeg" alt="the campsite">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br>
We headed back to our bikes, and rode back home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Did this make an everlasting impression on my son? Probably not.&lt;br>
But at least it was a chance for him to see that ordinary looking people are capable of extraordinary feats 💪, and we got a good morning ride out of it too!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"Just" run - part 1</title><link>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/07/just-run-part-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 00:05:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/07/just-run-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love to run, I do. But that&amp;rsquo;s more of a recent development…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of years ago, I was the guy who loved the good things in life as they say: cooking, eating, sleeping in, long wine-induced discussions, the more the better.
Sure, I was overweight and had trouble sleeping, but that was the price to pay for living The Good Life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, two things happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One was the traditional family picture on the 1st of January. I looked at myself and instantly knew this couldn&amp;rsquo;t go on like this. Nothing new there, I had been there before. Except, this time my siblings actually told me as well, and that hit hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second was when a chair collapsed under my weight a few weeks later. And then another chair a few days later. The furniture was literally telling me I was too heavy. That hit hard as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I started a keto diet. Its rules are very simple: no carbs, only protein and fat.
That means things like bread, pasta and sugary drinks, but also most fruits, were off limits. And that I could eat meat, eggs, cheese, a good selection of vegetables, and even an occasional glass of dry white wine.
Worked pretty well for me, being the bonvivant that I was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To support this diet, I figured that some exercise would do no harm. So I went and dug up my old running shoes to do regular sweat sessions around the block.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-first-race" >My first race
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#my-first-race">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>A year passes, it&amp;rsquo;s Christmas. I&amp;rsquo;m down 20 kg (yay!), slowly working my way to a healthy BMI. And I&amp;rsquo;m running 3 times a week and feeling pretty good about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve always needed a goal. The things I do need to lead somewhere, or else they&amp;rsquo;re not worth doing. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that&amp;rsquo;s just how I&amp;rsquo;m wired.
And with my target weight in sight, or at least the hint of it, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think I need something to keep maintaining my newfound healthy habits.
So I sign up for a race: the &lt;em>Eindejaarscorrida&lt;/em>, a full 8km through the city of Leuven just after Christmas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the time I ran (didn&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/63708615">Strava&lt;/a> account back then). I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much from the race itself. I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember whether or not I got a medal at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I do remember thinking: I look different. Not that I was heavier than most, of course I was. And I wasn&amp;rsquo;t running slower either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, I was running &lt;em>differently&lt;/em>: for every two steps I took, most other runners who were running at the same pace took 3 or even more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of it at that time. That would come much later.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-first-injury" >My first injury

&lt;a href="#my-first-injury">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>It started with pain on the inside of my left knee, the day after a run. It would go away when I ran again, only to come back more fiercly the day after.
I had been running pretty consistently for the past two years now, so this had to come from somewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First thing I tried was to rest. No running - full stop - for a week, then slowly build up again. That didn&amp;rsquo;t help, from the very first run I was hurting again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After googling some more, it hit me: shoes. I have no idea of the mileage on my old shoes, I probably &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; - mind the quotes - need a new pair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I got to the running store, I was given a long explanation about overpronation and supination, which did sound a bit like a sales pitch, but which would eventually led me to buy some Brooks &amp;ldquo;Beast&amp;rdquo;.
Solid new shoes, with extra-supersoft-cushioning, smart support, ideal for the heavy overpronating runner, yours truly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except, it didn&amp;rsquo;t fix my underlying problem. At least not in the long &amp;hellip; wait for it &amp;hellip; run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>(stay tuned for part 2)&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Not "Just" Hello World</title><link>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/06/not-just-hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/06/not-just-hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I&amp;rsquo;m finally starting a blog. &amp;ldquo;Just&amp;rdquo; do it, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, no. Actually, I&amp;rsquo;m re-starting a blog. For the fourth or fifth time, not sure. I&amp;rsquo;ve been going back and
forth a couple of times already in the past, but it seems one does not &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; start blogging. &lt;br>
Let alone make a habit out of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this first post, I want to get the common questions out of the way.&lt;br>
Let&amp;rsquo;s get this started, shall we?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="who-is-this-for" >Who is this for?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#who-is-this-for">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Me, mainly. I see it as a personal self-improvement experiment, to finally start writing, and to see where this will take me. &lt;br>
Boring stuff, really. Sorry, not sorry.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-will-you-write-about" >What will you write about?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#what-will-you-write-about">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In my humble experience, nothing is ever &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; anything. Which is why I put quotes around the word &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo;, whether
in characters when writing or with hand quotes when verbally uttering words. Can&amp;rsquo;t help it, it&amp;rsquo;s one of my quirks.
And it&amp;rsquo;s contagious too, ask my teammates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quotes around &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; have a number of cool side effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For one, once you start seeing things as not &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; anything, you open yourself up to be amazed by anything.
You discover that nothing is ordinary, that ordinary people do extraordinary things, and that nothing comes for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, it makes you feel good when you actually accomplish something - anything. \
Because when nothing is &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; anything, neither is that thing you just did!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And one more: consistently using quotes for the word &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; is an awesome guard against hubris (ὕβρις, love that word!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I&amp;rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. Stay tuned.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="no-seriously-what-will-you-write-about" >No, seriously. What will you write about?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#no-seriously-what-will-you-write-about">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Well, that ☝️, applied to examples from the context of my petty little life, both personal and professional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So expect topics like being a parent, software development, running a small business, reading, running, &amp;hellip; Tabletop RPG&amp;rsquo;s perhaps?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and maybe a dash of music, in particular the vocal kind.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="https://bverbeken.github.io/about/">Ben&lt;/a>, a software developer, singer, father, runner, reader, nerd, and that&amp;rsquo;s in no particular order.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-english" >Why English?

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>My native tongue is (a variant of) Dutch, which is what we speak in the northern half of Belgium (Vlaanderen/Flanders). \
Dutch would&amp;rsquo;ve been a great option too, this being a personal blog and all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, as a software developer I&amp;rsquo;m talking and writing English on a daily basis. And though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure yet where this blog is going, I &lt;em>am&lt;/em> certain that there will be some technical posts. Those will need to be in English, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write about software development in Dutch TBH.\&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It could very well be that I end up writing stuff in &lt;em>both&lt;/em> English and Dutch, depending on the topic. &lt;br>
We&amp;rsquo;ll see. For now English &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; feels like the natural thing to do.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
