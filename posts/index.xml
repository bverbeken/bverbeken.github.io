&lt;p>Losers is a series of single-story documentaries about people who &amp;ldquo;failed&amp;rdquo; in sports, sometimes in pretty spectacular ways. This particular episode was called &lt;em>Lost in the Desert&lt;/em>. It was the story of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauro_Prosperi">Mauro Prosperi&lt;/a>, a former Olympic athlete who met a sandstorm and (spoiler alert) nearly died in the desert of Morocco, during the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_des_Sables">Marathon des Sables&lt;/a>(1994).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you care about visuals, this documentary is honestly not worth your time. Most of it you&amp;rsquo;ll be spending watching either cartoons (srsly), interviews or stock footage of deserts. And the story is not exceptional either. I mean, I pretty much told you everything already, with the exception of some bat-eating and the really lucky rescue, in true deus-ex-machina fashion (ok I won&amp;rsquo;t spoil &lt;em>everything&lt;/em>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, the thing that triggered me was something the ex-wife, as the main narrator of the story, said early in the episode:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[Starting a family] should change life&amp;rsquo;s priorities. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t love sports or running anymore.
Instead, it means fitting it into a &lt;em>puzzle&lt;/em> that includes other pieces as well.
Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s selfishness, that&amp;rsquo;s not malicious, but it can only be called selfishness.
To think that one&amp;rsquo;s passion comes before everyone else &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s selfishness.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This notion of selfishness in pursuing personal passions got me thinking about how it applies to my own life, especially as a parent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Life often feels like a giant puzzle: you not only have to juggle your own life, but that of your kids too. And the more kids you have, the more balls you&amp;rsquo;ve got to keep in the air. Sure, there&amp;rsquo;s a bit of &amp;rsquo;economical juggle-nomics&amp;rsquo; involved - the more kids, the less each &amp;ldquo;life-ball&amp;rdquo; extra seems to weigh in the daily circus. And thankfully, it&amp;rsquo;s usually a tag-team act, not a solo performance.
But still.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that puzzle, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to convince yourself that &amp;lsquo;missing this training isn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal,&amp;rsquo; or that &amp;lsquo;skipping this run is okay compared to the kids&amp;rsquo; needs.&amp;rsquo; Just to be clear, I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about taking the lazy option and watch TV instead of going out for a run! What I mean is that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say &amp;ldquo;my training is important, and more important than [fill in kids duty here]&amp;rdquo;, so I do need to prioritise that run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And why is that hard? Because it &lt;em>feels selfish&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But is it, really?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been curious about how professional athletes navigate these choppy waters of family and personal ambition. Imagine the scene: a dedicated athlete telling their partner, &amp;ldquo;Honey, I can&amp;rsquo;t handle the grocery run today, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a tough interval training lined up.&amp;rdquo; Or perhaps, even more boldly, &amp;ldquo;Could you tackle the dishes tonight? I can&amp;rsquo;t, need to rest, coach&amp;rsquo;s orders.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And those are professional athletes, which means they can use the handy argument that it&amp;rsquo;s their actual &lt;em>job&lt;/em>. But what about the semi-pros, the weekend warriors? Their challenge is arguably even greater. So, how do they, and by extension we, strike this delicate balance?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer, of course, is simple: it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to have a good understanding with your partner and kids. Everyone must acknowledge that the pursuit of personal passions, like training, isn&amp;rsquo;t just a selfish whim; it&amp;rsquo;s something that enriches you, making you a better partner, parent, and person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, is balancing personal ambitions with family life a selfish act?
Perhaps not entirely. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s only sometimes, maybe, a tiny bit selfish. And that&amp;rsquo;s ok.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And with that thought, it&amp;rsquo;s time to lace up my running shoes. But this time I&amp;rsquo;ll start my warmup with a simple &amp;ldquo;Thank you&amp;rdquo; to my family. Because, at the end of the day, their support is what keeps me running – both literally and metaphorically.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Panta Rhei</title><link>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/07/panta-rhei/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/07/panta-rhei/</guid><description>&lt;p>I spend most of my professional time writing, deleting, reviewing and thinking about code. I do this at seats.io, a small company that I co-founded back in 2014.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seats.io does interactive floor plans for online ticketing websites. Our customers integrate our seating charts into their ticketing website or app: they write code, both on the front- and the backend, using API we &lt;a href="https://docs.seats.io/docs/">provide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And typically, that&amp;rsquo;s where the story ends: stuff works, and our customers expect stuff to keep working the way it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At least, that&amp;rsquo;s where it ends &lt;em>for them&lt;/em>. Most users only review their integration when they do an overhaul of their software, or when they run into issues and discover.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our product however, like any software product, changes over time at a much smaller granularity. We continuously fix bugs and build new features. Which means we need to make sure to keep everything running smoothly and not break any existing integrations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So then the question arises: how do you keep things the same, while changing them continuously at the same time? How do you not break existing integrations, while continuously evolving your product?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, there are two solutions to this.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Version your API. Let users choose their version.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run a single version, which is used by everyone. And keep everything backwards compatible.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="versioning-our-api-no-thanks" >Versioning our API? No thanks.
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#versioning-our-api-no-thanks">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>&lt;em>(Note: in the following, I&amp;rsquo;m specifically talking about SaaS products with a multi-tenant API here. This post is not about software libraries!)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a startup (ugh, I hate that word) like ours, you need to move, and you need to move &lt;em>fast&lt;/em>. You need to build something small, test it with a customer or two, then grow it, organically and in small steps. Change, see what works (and what does not!), and iteratively improve based on what you learned. The smaller the iterations, the better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now imagine creating, managing and running(!) a new version, every time you make a (potentially) breaking change. Before long, each one of your users is on a different version, each of which you need to maintain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll quickly end up in the realm of release calendars, planning and estimates. When all you want to do is push product out the door.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="backwards-compatibility-then" >Backwards Compatibility then?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#backwards-compatibility-then">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Well, that&amp;rsquo;s the route we took at seats.io. The rest of this post is about how we make that work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Running a single version in production at any given time has a number of major advantages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about version numbers. No discussions about whether something is a bug fix or a new feature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There&amp;rsquo;s no need for a release schedule or calendar, or even planning whatsoever. You&amp;rsquo;re completely free to deploy new versions at will; though I would recommend to keep a changelog for past changes, of course.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Users don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about upgrading. They get all the good stuff right away without doing anything!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The disadvantage though, is that you make the burden of not breaking stuff your own: you have to live up to the responsibility of not breaking your customer&amp;rsquo;s code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s not an easy feat, considering that breaking changes come in many flavours.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The most obvious form of a breaking change is a technical one. E.g. you change or remove an API endpoint on which integrators are relying.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You make a change to a feature with only its &lt;em>intended&lt;/em> use case in mind. In other words: you think this feature does X, but for some users it does Y as well. After your change, they cannot use the feature for their use case anymore, and so in their eyes, you are breaking their product.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Changing internal/non-documented API, on which you assume no-one is relying, but in fact they are 😱.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>shocking users. Your change does not &lt;em>technically&lt;/em> break anything, but you change the behaviour or even looks in such a way that users are shocked and don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do anymore. Usually happens with the less technically gifted, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a hard rule.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixing a bug on which integrators depend. The line between a bug and a feature is not a line, it&amp;rsquo;s a gradient.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="changing-tactics" >Changing tactics
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#changing-tactics">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>So in short, any change can be a breaking change. And you have no way to surely predict whether a change will turn out to be a breaking one, because much of the breaking happens in the head or the code of your users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What &lt;em>can&lt;/em> you do, then? Well, here&amp;rsquo;s a couple of tactics we use.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Add, don&amp;rsquo;t modify or remove.&lt;/strong>
If you can change without breaking anything, do that. Good examples are adding a field to a json object you expose on an API endpoint. Obviously, an extensive automated test suite helps here.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Warn, don&amp;rsquo;t throw.&lt;/strong>
Sometimes, you can avoid actually breaking stuff by instead giving a warning, e.g. in the browsers console. For instance, we never just remove configuration options on our seating charts. Instead, we log a warning saying this option is now deprecated, and we measure the use. &lt;br>
While this does result in sometimes long periods of time during which a feature is deprecated, at least you didn&amp;rsquo;t break.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Feature Flags!&lt;/strong>
Most of the time, if we cannot solve a problem in a 100% backwards compatible way, we create a feature flag: a configuration option that allows you to switch between the old and the new behaviour. You can then enable that feature flag for new signups, and keep it disabled for existing users - unless they ask to be switched. &lt;br>
Yes, this comes at the price of extra complexity, but at least you&amp;rsquo;re not breaking your customer&amp;rsquo;s product. Nor their trust.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Be comfortable breaking it&lt;/strong>
Sometimes, when discussing a feature&amp;rsquo;s backwards compatibility, we say things like &amp;ldquo;Oh God I hope nobody&amp;rsquo;s doing [insert crazy idea here]. They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t would they?&amp;rdquo; (they would). Or we didn&amp;rsquo;t even think about the possibility that someone out there might be using that particular non-documented field and remove it.
If we then go ahead, make the change, and it turns out to actually break stuff for that customer (it&amp;rsquo;s always just a single one in this case), we either roll back the deploy and give them some time to fix their integration, or propose a workaround.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="its-all-about-the-team" >It&amp;rsquo;s all about the team
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#its-all-about-the-team">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The tactics above will help, but not cover all the cases. So besides those, there are practices (ugh, another ugly word) we use to mitigate the chances of introducing breaking changes, or at least have a way to deal with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>backwards compatibility should always be top of mind&lt;/strong>
Whenever we discuss features, bugs, support requests, anything product-related really, we always, always ask ourselves: can this solution break stuff, and how? It&amp;rsquo;s a team reflex.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Know your users, know your product&lt;/strong>
Seats.io offers a myriad of features (best available seat selection, bookable tables, boxes, sales channels, social distancing, ticket pricing and discounts, season tickets, etc etc), to over 250 customers globally who all use different combinations of those features, on different sizes and types of venues (stadiums, theatres, table layouts, multi-floor trade shows, etc), and for different reasons (ticketing, registration, checkin, etc). &lt;br>
If you need to maintain backwards compatibiility in such a context, you need to know who is using what and what for. Or at least be able to quickly answer that question for a given feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Test, test, and then test some more.&lt;/strong>
Of course, you need an automated test suite you can trust and fall back on. The problem is that that&amp;rsquo;s just part of the story. You can only write tests based on your own assumptions, and your customers might be making different assumptions. &lt;br>
That&amp;rsquo;s why, everytime we deploy a new version, we first test live customer sites against the new version (e.g. using &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd?hl=en">Chrome Redirector&lt;/a>). Not only does that help detecting breaking changes, it&amp;rsquo;s also a great way to get to know your customers and what they do with your product!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Be aware that this takes trust, and that trust takes time&lt;/strong>
It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to tell customers that they don&amp;rsquo;t have to bother with upgrades. It&amp;rsquo;s another to actually convince them they can trust you. And building trust takes time. &lt;br>
Which takes me to 👇&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Be open about mistakes&lt;/strong>
When you do break things, it will happen eventually, be upfront about what happened. Investigate, contact your users, let them know you understand this is important. And do your stinking best to fix it asap.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Be prepared to roll back.&lt;/strong>
Deploy small changes, and deploy often. Don&amp;rsquo;t deploy right before heading home to feed the kids. Have a &amp;ldquo;roll back deploy&amp;rdquo; button nearby. Test that button once in a while. You know the drill, those things are important.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>In this post, I made the point that versioning the API of your SaaS business is a bad idea, why we went for the backwards compatibility route, and listed some strategies we use in our team to make that route work for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, I want to stress that this is about the API itself. There&amp;rsquo;s more than meets the eye here: For instance, we do have API wrapper libraries (in Java, js, ruby, python and whatnot), which are &lt;em>of course&lt;/em> versioned using &lt;a href="https://semver.org/">SemVer&lt;/a>. I might write a follow-up post on the difference between the two approaches.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book review: Deep Work</title><link>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/07/deep-work-book/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2022 20:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/07/deep-work-book/</guid><description>&lt;p>A couple of days ago, I finished reading Deep Work by Cal Newport.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, it&amp;rsquo;s a very typical self-improvement book: find a silver bullet (&lt;em>in casu&lt;/em>, the ability to focus), use the first half of the book to explain why your Unique Concept is the new silver bullet. Then fill the second half with practical tips and how-to&amp;rsquo;s. Pretty standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this one did hit a nerve with me: I&amp;rsquo;ve personally been struggling with keeping my focus for quite some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here&amp;rsquo;s what I took from reading Deep Work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="overview" >Overview
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#overview">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>First, a quick summary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="part-i-deep-work-what--why" >Part I: Deep Work, What &amp;amp; Why
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#part-i-deep-work-what--why">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Newport uses the first 75 pages to explain what he means by deep work, and why it matters. He defines deep work as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This &lt;em>state of distraction-free concentration&lt;/em> is not something that comes for free, it&amp;rsquo;s a skill that can be trained.
Newport then argues that this skill is getting more and more rare, and at the same time more and more valuable for knowledge workers in this day and age.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Shallow&lt;/em> work is, of course, the opposite:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>As a software developer, I am familiar with &lt;em>being in the zone&lt;/em>. Sometimes, not often, it happens that I am able to focus continuously for a couple of hours on a single, usually intelectually challenging, task. Unsurprisingly, that&amp;rsquo;s when stuff gets done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m even more so familiar with shallow work. For instance, I find it near-to-impossible to focus when at home. Just too many distractions everywhere, even when I&amp;rsquo;m alone. I also have the bad habit of opening up the same news sites in my browser, multiple times a day. Not because I want to know what&amp;rsquo;s going on, but because my fingers just happen to type in the combination. It&amp;rsquo;s completely automatic, a bad habit at best, an addiction at worst 😱&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when Cal Newport suggests that focus is a skill, a muscle you can train, then I&amp;rsquo;m all ears!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="part-ii-deep-work-how" >Part II: Deep Work, How
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#part-ii-deep-work-how">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In four chapters, Newport lists 4 &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo;, each of them with their own examples, practical tips and reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Work deeply&lt;/strong>: how do you turn deep work into a regular and significant part of your daily life. That is to say: into a habit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Embrace boredom&lt;/strong>: teach yourself that it&amp;rsquo;s ok to not be doing anything. That way, you won&amp;rsquo;t feel the need to fill empty gaps of time so much, which in turn will help you to focus when you need to.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Quit social media&lt;/strong>: pretty obvious, this one. The main idea in this chapter is to &lt;em>choose your tools wisely&lt;/em>. Don&amp;rsquo;t just accept that if a tool provides any benefit, that that benefit is enough to justify your use of that tool. There are negatives to be considered as well, and those negatives tend to be massively underestimated when it comes to social media.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Drain the shallows&lt;/strong>: Tips and tricks to minimize shallow work. For example: plan every minute of your day (including shallow work), make it visible by giving yourself a daily &lt;em>shallow work budget&lt;/em>, and put more work into fewer emails. I liked this chapter the most.&lt;/li>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go over all the tips and tricks Newport lists in his book. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m going to pick out some of the things that made most sense to me, and list a few changes I made. Let&amp;rsquo;s see in a few months whether these changes were actually improvements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="daily-routine-tweaks" >Daily routine tweaks
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#daily-routine-tweaks">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I already had a task system, loosely based on &lt;a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD&lt;/a>, that works pretty well for me. I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things 3&lt;/a> with a small number of recurring tasks set up, one of which is a &amp;ldquo;daily routine&amp;rdquo; checklist that I go through each morning at 10am. It contains things like the list of inboxes to clear, &amp;ldquo;look at the 2 upcoming days&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;check training calendar&amp;rdquo;, amongst other things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on what I learned from Deep Work, I made two changes to that daily routine:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Start early &lt;br>
Instead of going through the list at 10am when I&amp;rsquo;m at work already, I do this first thing in the morning, sometimes even before or during my morning coffee. I&amp;rsquo;m usually up before everyone else in the house, so that&amp;rsquo;s a perfect time for some quiet daily planning.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>make a schedule instead of a task list &lt;br>
Instead of simply listing the tasks for today, I&amp;rsquo;m assigning a time (and implicitly, an estimated duration) to each of the tasks. And I make sure to include time for emails, providing support, and even relaxing. &lt;br>
Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of planning and estimating. But the point of this plan is not to follow it! Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s to make it mentally easy to choose the next thing to do. Rather than having to pick something from my list (and have the silent option to open facebook), I&amp;rsquo;ll already know what the next thing is, because I already made that decision earlier. Easy-peasy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="pomodoro-timer" >Pomodoro timer

&lt;a href="#pomodoro-timer">

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Not technically a tip from Deep Work, but it fits the idea well: I&amp;rsquo;ve installed the free and awesome &lt;a href="https://flowapp.info/">Flow&lt;/a> app on my Mac. It allows me to start a timer of 30 minutes and - this is important - automatically block certain apps, such as my instant messaging and email clients for the duration of that timer. The simple fact that I need to add another step (i.e. stop the timer) to open up those apps, makes me realize I&amp;rsquo;m going out of focus, and that is enough to reconsider.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve removed the facebook, Twitter and reddit apps from my phone. I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to close my accounts just yet, since I do think there&amp;rsquo;s value in them. For example, some important conversations only happen through Messenger, and I cannot afford to miss out on those, socially speaking. I am, however, able to decide when and where I want to check those messages, rather than have them pushed to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have not removed the &lt;em>useful&lt;/em> social media apps, which are Strava and GoodReads. Both of them provide me with enough value (motivation!) for them to be on my phone. I had their notifications disabled anyway.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Deep Work was an interesting read. I took some advice and tweaked my system a bit. Only time will tell whether this will actually improve my ability to focus. If not, I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll rinse and repeat.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trip to Another One Bites The Dust</title><link>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/07/another-one-bites-the-dust/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 00:22:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/07/another-one-bites-the-dust/</guid><description>&lt;p>Woke up early this morning. Not that that&amp;rsquo;s particularly unusual, but today was with a good reason: I&amp;rsquo;d promised my son to take him for a bike ride.
You see, he&amp;rsquo;s quite an active little fella who needs his daily dose of physical activity. And I&amp;rsquo;m happy to fix him up :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve always found that actually &lt;em>going somewhere&lt;/em> is much more interesting than &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; going for a ride.
It feels a lot less like training that way, haha.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead of riding around in a circle, I took my son to go see &lt;a href="https://www.anotheronebitesthedust.be/">Another One Bites The Dust&lt;/a> (AOBtD), an ultra race that was - and, at the time of writing, is still - being held in Bierbeek.
That&amp;rsquo;s at some 20 km from where we live, aka the perfect distance for a saturday morning round trip.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ultra-what" >Ultra what?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#ultra-what">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>According to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramarathon">Wikipedia&lt;/a>, an ultra running race is &amp;ldquo;any footrace longer than traditional marathon length of 42.195 km&amp;rdquo;.
Some races run over a certain distance (e.g. 50km, 100km, 100 miles), and others last for a predetermined time (e.g. 24 hour runs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Backyard / One More Loop type races are different: there is no predefined finish, either in distance nor time.
Instead, participants run a short loop (typically 6.7 km or 4.167 miles, to make for 100 miles in 24 hours) once every hour.
The last one standing wins, the others get DNF behind their names.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say it takes a special kind of special to even consider signing up for such a race.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fun fact: earlier, in May, a Belgian, Merijn Geerts, set a new world record: he ran 90 loops of 6.7km in Rettert, Germany.
That&amp;rsquo;s 603.5 km (!).
In almost 4 days (!!).
Without actual real sleep, other than the occasional 5-minute nap in between loops (!!!!😳)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other fun fact: that same Merijn Geerts won the past three editions of AOBtD.&lt;/p>

So off we went on our bikes, to go superhero-spotting in Bierbeek. We arrived on the scene at around 10:35.
Just in time to see the runners returning from their 15th loop of 5.959 km, meaning they had just started their 3rd marathon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Atypical runners in an atypical race&lt;/strong> &lt;br>
I had expected to see sharp-as-a-knife athletes, well-equipped and looking serious and seriously tired.
And there were some of those, but they were definitely not the majority.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, most were walking, chatting and smiling (!). Some wore a backpack, others what looked like shorts you&amp;rsquo;d wear to the beach.
I saw only one runner with poles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And there were no bib numbers to be seen, they wore removable ankle bracelets for time registration instead.
I guess that makes changing shirts a lot more practical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br>
&lt;strong>friendly &amp;amp; no-nonsense&lt;/strong> &lt;br>
My son and I were welcomed by a friendly lady, who explained that there was no entry fee. They did have an &lt;em>honesty box&lt;/em> though, so we put in some
money and were told we could help ourselves to some drinks or food.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think we were the only actual supporters; the rest of the people were runners, their crew, or the race crew. But we didn&amp;rsquo;t feel out of place or unwelcome at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Not much going on, but so much to see&lt;/strong> &lt;br>
The summer heat was coming up, I heard distant screaming from kids on a bouncy castle. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember any music though.
A smoldering camp fire filled the air with the scent of summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We just sat down, had a drink and watched runners coming in. At ten to eleven, when the next loop would start, someone shouted &amp;ldquo;Ten Minutes!&amp;rdquo;. Then nothing for five minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At five to eleven (&amp;ldquo;Five Minutes!&amp;rdquo;) people started gathering at the gate, then progressively more as the start of the next hour and so the next loop approached.
Some runners were still coming in and didn&amp;rsquo;t even take the time to sit down.
Others took a chair to the start to sit and take naps until the last second, or were nibbling away a pack of salty crackers or candy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, 11 o&amp;rsquo;clock came, someone blew a horn, everyone clapped, the runners ran - or walked - through the gate, and the campsite was calm and peaceful once more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../another-one-bites-the-dust/2.jpeg" alt="the campsite">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br>
We headed back to our bikes, and rode back home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Did this make an everlasting impression on my son? Probably not.&lt;br>
But at least it was a chance for him to see that ordinary looking people are capable of extraordinary feats 💪, and we got a good morning ride out of it too!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"Just" run - part 1</title><link>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/07/just-run-part-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 00:05:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/07/just-run-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love to run, I do. But that&amp;rsquo;s more of a recent development…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of years ago, I was the guy who loved the good things in life as they say: cooking, eating, sleeping in, long wine-induced discussions, the more the better.
Sure, I was overweight and had trouble sleeping, but that was the price to pay for living The Good Life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, two things happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One was the traditional family picture on the 1st of January. I looked at myself and instantly knew this couldn&amp;rsquo;t go on like this. Nothing new there, I had been there before. Except, this time my siblings actually told me as well, and that hit hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second was when a chair collapsed under my weight a few weeks later. And then another chair a few days later. The furniture was literally telling me I was too heavy. That hit hard as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I started a keto diet. Its rules are very simple: no carbs, only protein and fat.
That means things like bread, pasta and sugary drinks, but also most fruits, were off limits. And that I could eat meat, eggs, cheese, a good selection of vegetables, and even an occasional glass of dry white wine.
Worked pretty well for me, being the bonvivant that I was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To support this diet, I figured that some exercise would do no harm. So I went and dug up my old running shoes to do regular sweat sessions around the block.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-first-race" >My first race
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#my-first-race">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>A year passes, it&amp;rsquo;s Christmas. I&amp;rsquo;m down 20 kg (yay!), slowly working my way to a healthy BMI. And I&amp;rsquo;m running 3 times a week and feeling pretty good about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve always needed a goal. The things I do need to lead somewhere, or else they&amp;rsquo;re not worth doing. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that&amp;rsquo;s just how I&amp;rsquo;m wired.
And with my target weight in sight, or at least the hint of it, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think I need something to keep maintaining my newfound healthy habits.
So I sign up for a race: the &lt;em>Eindejaarscorrida&lt;/em>, a full 8km through the city of Leuven just after Christmas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the time I ran (didn&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/63708615">Strava&lt;/a> account back then). I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much from the race itself. I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember whether or not I got a medal at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I do remember thinking: I look different. Not that I was heavier than most, of course I was. And I wasn&amp;rsquo;t running slower either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, I was running &lt;em>differently&lt;/em>: for every two steps I took, most other runners who were running at the same pace took 3 or even more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of it at that time. That would come much later.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>It started with pain on the inside of my left knee, the day after a run. It would go away when I ran again, only to come back more fiercly the day after.
I had been running pretty consistently for the past two years now, so this had to come from somewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First thing I tried was to rest. No running - full stop - for a week, then slowly build up again. That didn&amp;rsquo;t help, from the very first run I was hurting again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After googling some more, it hit me: shoes. I have no idea of the mileage on my old shoes, I probably &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; - mind the quotes - need a new pair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I got to the running store, I was given a long explanation about overpronation and supination, which did sound a bit like a sales pitch, but which would eventually led me to buy some Brooks &amp;ldquo;Beast&amp;rdquo;.
Solid new shoes, with extra-supersoft-cushioning, smart support, ideal for the heavy overpronating runner, yours truly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except, it didn&amp;rsquo;t fix my underlying problem. At least not in the long &amp;hellip; wait for it &amp;hellip; run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>(stay tuned for part 2)&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Not "Just" Hello World</title><link>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/06/not-just-hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/06/not-just-hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I&amp;rsquo;m finally starting a blog. &amp;ldquo;Just&amp;rdquo; do it, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, no. Actually, I&amp;rsquo;m re-starting a blog. For the fourth or fifth time, not sure. I&amp;rsquo;ve been going back and
forth a couple of times already in the past, but it seems one does not &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; start blogging. &lt;br>
Let alone make a habit out of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this first post, I want to get the common questions out of the way.&lt;br>
Let&amp;rsquo;s get this started, shall we?&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In my humble experience, nothing is ever &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; anything. Which is why I put quotes around the word &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo;, whether
in characters when writing or with hand quotes when verbally uttering words. Can&amp;rsquo;t help it, it&amp;rsquo;s one of my quirks.
And it&amp;rsquo;s contagious too, ask my teammates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quotes around &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; have a number of cool side effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For one, once you start seeing things as not &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; anything, you open yourself up to be amazed by anything.
You discover that nothing is ordinary, that ordinary people do extraordinary things, and that nothing comes for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, it makes you feel good when you actually accomplish something - anything. \
Because when nothing is &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; anything, neither is that thing you just did!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And one more: consistently using quotes for the word &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; is an awesome guard against hubris (ὕβρις, love that word!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I&amp;rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. Stay tuned.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Well, that ☝️, applied to examples from the context of my petty little life, both personal and professional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So expect topics like being a parent, software development, running a small business, reading, running, &amp;hellip; Tabletop RPG&amp;rsquo;s perhaps?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and maybe a dash of music, in particular the vocal kind.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>My native tongue is (a variant of) Dutch, which is what we speak in the northern half of Belgium (Vlaanderen/Flanders). \
Dutch would&amp;rsquo;ve been a great option too, this being a personal blog and all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, as a software developer I&amp;rsquo;m talking and writing English on a daily basis. And though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure yet where this blog is going, I &lt;em>am&lt;/em> certain that there will be some technical posts. Those will need to be in English, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write about software development in Dutch TBH.\&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It could very well be that I end up writing stuff in &lt;em>both&lt;/em> English and Dutch, depending on the topic. &lt;br>
We&amp;rsquo;ll see. For now English &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; feels like the natural thing to do.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
