But that&amp;rsquo;s more of a recent development…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of years ago, I was the guy who loved the good things in life as they say: cooking, eating, sleeping in, long wine-induced discussions, the more the better.
Sure, I was overweight and had trouble sleeping, but that was the price to pay for living The Good Life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, two things happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One was the traditional family picture on the 1st of January. I looked at myself and instantly knew this couldn&amp;rsquo;t go on like this. Nothing new there, I had been there before. Except, this time my siblings actually told me as well, and that hit hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second was when a chair collapsed under my weight a few weeks later. And then another chair a few days later. The furniture was literally telling me I was too heavy. That hit hard as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I started a keto diet. Its rules are very simple: no carbs, only protein and fat.
That means things like bread, pasta and sugary drinks, but also most fruits, were off limits. And that I could eat meat, eggs, cheese, a good selection of vegetables, and even an occasional glass of dry white wine.
Worked pretty well for me, being the bonvivant that I was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To support this diet, I figured that some exercise would do no harm. So I went and dug up my old running shoes to do regular sweat sessions around the block.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-first-race" >My first race
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#my-first-race">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>A year passes, it&amp;rsquo;s Christmas. I&amp;rsquo;m down 20 kg (yay!), slowly working my way to a healthy BMI. And I&amp;rsquo;m running 3 times a week and feeling pretty good about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve always needed a goal. The things I do need to lead somewhere, or else they&amp;rsquo;re not worth doing. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that&amp;rsquo;s just how I&amp;rsquo;m wired.
And with my target weight in sight, or at least the hint of it, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think I need something to keep maintaining my newfound healthy habits.
So I sign up for a race: the &lt;em>Eindejaarscorrida&lt;/em>, a full 8km through the city of Leuven just after Christmas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the time I ran (didn&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/63708615">Strava&lt;/a> account back then). I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much from the race itself. I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember whether or not I got a medal at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I do remember thinking: I look different. Not that I was heavier than most, of course I was. And I wasn&amp;rsquo;t running slower either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, I was running &lt;em>differently&lt;/em>: for every two steps I took, most other runners who were running at the same pace took 3 or even more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of it at that time. That would come much later.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>It started with pain on the inside of my left knee, the day after a run. It would go away when I ran again, only to come back more fiercly the day after.
I had been running pretty consistently for the past two years now, so this had to come from somewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First thing I tried was to rest. No running - full stop - for a week, then slowly build up again. That didn&amp;rsquo;t help, from the very first run I was hurting again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After googling some more, it hit me: shoes. I have no idea of the mileage on my old shoes, I probably &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; - mind the quotes - need a new pair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I got to the running store, I was given a long explanation about overpronation and supination, which did sound a bit like a sales pitch, but which would eventually led me to buy some Brooks &amp;ldquo;Beast&amp;rdquo;.
Solid new shoes, with extra-supersoft-cushioning, smart support, ideal for the heavy overpronating runner, yours truly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except, it didn&amp;rsquo;t fix my underlying problem. At least not in the long &amp;hellip; wait for it &amp;hellip; run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>(stay tuned for part 2)&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Not "Just" Hello World</title><link>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/1-not-just-hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/1-not-just-hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I&amp;rsquo;m finally starting a blog. &amp;ldquo;Just&amp;rdquo; do it, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, no. Actually, I&amp;rsquo;m re-starting a blog. For the fourth or fifth time, not sure. I&amp;rsquo;ve been going back and
forth a couple of times already in the past, but it seems one does not &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; start blogging. &lt;br>
Let alone make a habit out of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this first post, I want to get the common questions out of the way.&lt;br>
Let&amp;rsquo;s get this started, shall we?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="who-is-this-for" >Who is this for?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#who-is-this-for">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Me, mainly. I see it as a personal self-improvement experiment, to finally start writing, and to see where this will take me. &lt;br>
Boring stuff, really. Sorry, not sorry.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-will-you-write-about" >What will you write about?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#what-will-you-write-about">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In my humble experience, nothing is ever &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; anything. Which is why I put quotes around the word &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo;, whether
in characters when writing or with hand quotes when verbally uttering words. Can&amp;rsquo;t help it, it&amp;rsquo;s one of my quirks.
And it&amp;rsquo;s contagious too, ask my teammates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quotes around &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; have a number of cool side effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For one, once you start seeing things as not &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; anything, you open yourself up to be amazed by anything.
You discover that nothing is ordinary, that ordinary people do extraordinary things, and that nothing comes for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, it makes you feel good when you actually accomplish something - anything. \
Because when nothing is &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; anything, neither is that thing you just did!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And one more: consistently using quotes for the word &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; is an awesome guard against hubris (ὕβρις, love that word!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I&amp;rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. Stay tuned.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="no-seriously-what-will-you-write-about" >No, seriously. What will you write about?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#no-seriously-what-will-you-write-about">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Well, that ☝️, applied to examples from the context of my petty little life, both personal and professional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So expect topics like being a parent, software development, running a small business, reading, running, &amp;hellip; Tabletop RPG&amp;rsquo;s perhaps?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and maybe a dash of music, in particular the vocal kind.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="https://bverbeken.github.io/about/">Ben&lt;/a>, a software developer, singer, father, runner, reader, nerd, and that&amp;rsquo;s in no particular order.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-english" >Why English?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#why-english">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>My native tongue is (a variant of) Dutch, which is what we speak in the northern half of Belgium (Vlaanderen/Flanders). \
Dutch would&amp;rsquo;ve been a great option too, this being a personal blog and all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, as a software developer I&amp;rsquo;m talking and writing English on a daily basis. And though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure yet where this blog is going, I &lt;em>am&lt;/em> certain that there will be some technical posts. Those will need to be in English, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write about software development in Dutch TBH.\&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It could very well be that I end up writing stuff in &lt;em>both&lt;/em> English and Dutch, depending on the topic. &lt;br>
We&amp;rsquo;ll see. For now English &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; feels like the natural thing to do.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
