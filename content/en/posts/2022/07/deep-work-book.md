# Part I: Deep Work, What & Why 
Newport uses the first 75 pages to explain what he means by deep work, and why it matters. He defines deep work as follows:

> Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. 

This _state of distraction-free concentration_ is not something that comes for free, it's a skill that can be trained. 
Newport furthermore argues this skill is getting more and more rare, and at the same time more and more valuable for knowledge workers in this day and age. 

_Shallow_ work is the exact opposite: 

> Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate. 

As a software developer, I am familiar with _being in the zone_. Sometimes, not often, it happens that I am able to focus continuously for a couple of hours on a single, usually intelectually challenging, task. Unsurprisingly, that's when stuff gets done.   

Unfortunately, I'm even more so familiar with shallow work. For instance, I find it near-to-impossible to focus when at home. Just too many distractions everywhere, even when I'm alone. 

So when Cal Newport suggests that focus is a skill, a muscle you can train, then I'm all ears! 

# Part II: How

## 1. Work Deeply
Rule 1 = How to transform deep work from an aspiration into a regular and significant part of your daily life. (rules 2 - 3 - 4 wil then help you get the most out of this habbit)
Willppower alone doesn't cut it: you have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. So you need to move beyond good intentions, and add _routines_ and _rituals_, to make it into a habit. Then you don't need to use your limited willpower.

6 strategies: 
- decide on your depth philosophy (101): monastic, bimodal, rhytmic, journalistic 
- ritualize
- make grand gestures p121
- Dont work alone
- Execute like a business
- be lazy 142
   
## 2. Embrace Boredom
- don't take breaks from distraction, take breaks from focus
- work like Teddy Roosevelt
- Meditate productively
- memorize a deck of cards 174
 
## 3. Quit Social Media
- Choose your tools wisely
- be wary of the any-benefit approach
- 
 
## 4. rain The Shallows


# Review
Personally, I did not find a lot of shockingly new information in this book. I mean, deliberate practice   

I did like the way Newport structured the ideas into very clear parts and sections. That made writing the above summary rather trivial :) 
But it also made it easy to go back and browse previous ideas while reading. Which, in turn, simplifies memorizing those ideas.
