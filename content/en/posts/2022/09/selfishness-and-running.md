Yesterday, I was watching an episode of Losers on Netflix, and I got triggered. So I'll bite :) 

First the intro. Losers is a series of single-story documentaries about people who "failed" in sports, sometimes in spectacular ways.    
This particular episode was called _Lost in the Desert_. It was the story of Mauro Prosperian, a former olympic athlete who met a sandstorm almost died in the desert of Morocco, during the Marathon des Sables (1994). 

If you care about visuals, this documentary is not worth your time tbh. Most of it you'll be looking at either cartoons (really), interviews or stock footage of deserts. 

If you care about good stories, this documentary is, I'm sorry to say, not worth your time either. I mean, there's not so much to tell: the guy goes running in the desert, gets lost, eats bats, and would surely have died if it weren't for a proper deus-ex-machina rescue.     

So how did I get triggered? They brought in the ex-wife. She's actually the main narrator of the story. And one of the first things she says is this: 

> [Starting a family] should change life's priorities. It doesn't mean you can't love sports or running anymore.
> Instead, it means fitting it into a puzzle that includes other pieces as well. 
> Perhaps it's selfishness, that's not malicious, but it can only be called selfishness. 
> To think that one's passion comes before everyone else ... it's selfishness.
