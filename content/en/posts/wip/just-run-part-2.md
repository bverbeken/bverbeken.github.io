(The second part on my running journey so far. Read part 1 here)

We're writing Spring 2019. I got my new super-fancy and super-cushioned pair of Brooks Beast running shoes, and things seem to go well for a while. I bump my mileage, but I'm not measuring anything of course. Everything is feeling. 

Sure, my knees hurt when I get up in the morning, but when I go for a run that pain disappears pretty quickly, so we're good. I thought. 

Until
