# Hi, I'm \"just\" Ben 👋

Everyone wears multiple hats. These are mine. 


## dev & overall nerd
I write code for a living. I play tabletop RPG's and occasionally participate in MTG drafts. I'm an introvert, who has issues with starting small talk.    

What can I say? 🤷‍️   

## Parent / Family man
I'm a father of three - of course beautiful - children, each with their own quirks, strengths and challenges. 

Being a parent is IMHO the hardest thing one can do, by far. It means a huge responsibility, tough split-second decisions that can bear far-reaching consequences, and constant surprises around the corner.    
It's the most beautiful job in the world.     

Kids, if you happen to read this one day: ik zie ulle graag. 

## Runner
A couple of years ago, I was pretty overweight. On a beautiful January 1, I decided that had to stop. 
So I cut eating carbs out of my diet and took up running to burn a bit faster. 

And then the strangest thing happened: I actually started to like going for a run! 
    
Next thing you know, I'm a middle-of-the-packer, running 3-5 times a week, and ran a - slow but full - [marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/6127388564/overview).    

I'm now watching my diet to be able to run harder/better/faster, instead of the other way around. 

## Singer
I've been singing all of my life, both in choirs and solo. 

Since a few years I'm singing as a (counter)tenor in an a capella/barberhop band called [Captain Sugar & The Daddies](https://www.facebook.com/cptsugar). 

## Reader
I make a point of reading at least 10 minutes daily, usually before going to bed. 

I keep a list on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6076790-ben).
