Woke up early this morning. Not that that's particularly unusual, but today was with a good reason: I'd promised my son to take him for a bike ride. 
You see, he's quite an active little fella who needs his daily dose of physical activity. And I'm happy to fix him up :)

Now, I've always found that actually _going somewhere_ is much more interesting than "just" going for a ride. It feels a lot less like training that way, haha.   
So instead of riding around in a circle, I took my son to go see Another One Bites The Dust, an ultra race that was - and, at the time of writing, is still - being held in Bierbeek. 
That's at some 20 km from where we live, aka the perfect distance for a saturday morning round trip. 

# Ultra? 
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramarathon), an ultra running race is "any footrace longer than traditional marathon length of 42.195 km". 
Some races run over a certain distance (e.g. 50km, 100km, 100 miles), and others last for a predetermined time (e.g. 24 hour runs).

_Backyard_ / One More Loop type races are different: there's neither a preset distance, nor a period of time. 
Instead, participants run a short loop (typically 6.7 km) once every hour. The last man standing wins, the others get DNF behind their names. 

Fun fact: earlier, in May, a Belgian, Merijn Geerts, set a new world record: he ran 90 loops of 6.7km in Rettert, Germany. That's 603.5 km in almost 4 days.

Other fun fact: The same Merijn Geerts won the past three editions of AOBtD.

# Impressions

* Very friendly, no-nonsense people
* Not much going on. When we were there
* The runners are, well, atypical: age, weight
* It takes a special kind of special

Now, I'm not a big fan of simply going for a round trip, I like to _go somewhere_ instead of just turning around in circles.   

So off we went on our bikes, superhero-spotting.
