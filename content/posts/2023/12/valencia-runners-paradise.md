I'm in Valencia for a team building. As seats.io is a remote company, we often see and talk to each other, but only by the pixels of a screen. And because a screen can never beat IRL conversation, we've gathered in Valencia for the week.

This blog post is not about remote company retreats though; its only purpose is to sing the praise of Valencia as the Ciudad del Running.

You see, I went for a [morning run](https://www.strava.com/activities/10336173198) yesterday, and I could not _not_ go for [another one](https://www.strava.com/activities/10341462306) this morning, despite a pretty short night.

Only one reason: [Turia Garden](https://www.visitvalencia.com/en/what-to-see-valencia/turia-gardens). Spanning 9 kilometers, this elongated oasis, curled around the old town, is a marvel repurposed from an old riverbed. It's nothing short of runners' paradise.

* Its **accessibility** is a dream - from anywhere in the city, you're just a short jog away. For me, it was a straight shot down a palm-lined avenue from our hotel.
* **Uninterrupted Paths**: The park's design segregates paths for different activities - biking, walking, and running. This means you can "just" run, for as long as you like, totally immersed and without any distractions or stops (no traffic lights! ðŸš¦)
* **Runner-Friendly Surface**: The gravel paths are kind to the knees, making the run as comfortable as it is scenic.
* Speaking of **scenery**, it's incredibly varied. Contrary to what one might expect from a former riverbed, the park is far from monotonous. It's a mosaic of landscapes, gardens, sports fields, children's playgrounds, small forests of exotic trees, cut into strips by a wild variety of ancient and modern bridges. At the park's far end lies the Ciutat de les Arts i les CiÃ¨ncies, a striking contrast that catapults you into a futuristic landscape, blending art, science, and architecture.
* Regularly spaced **distance markers** that light up at night, very helpful for interval trainings.
* **The Community Vibe**: runners of all ages, sizes, and speeds run in Turia park, either solo or in groups. I saw what looked like a rugby team warming up, I saw obviously very seasoned runners struggling (maybe they were recovering from the Valencia Marathon that was held on Sunday, who knows), and I saw people running with a stroller.

Thanks, Valencia, for the great runs and vibes. You've earned your title as the Ciudad del Running. Can't wait to come back and hit those paths again.
