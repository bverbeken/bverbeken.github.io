We're writing Spring 2019. I got my new super-fancy and super-cushioned pair of Brooks Beast running shoes, and things seem to go well for a while. I gradually bump my mileage, but I'm not measuring anything of course. Everything is feeling and feeling is everything.

Sure, my knees hurt when I get up in the morning, but when I go for a run that pain disappears pretty quickly, so I was good. Or so I thought.

## My Second Injury
Fast forward to May 2020. I'm clocking in 30-40km a week over four runs, yet the familiar pain in my knees greets me every morning. But then, unexpectedly, the pain lingers even during my runs.

Concerned, I consult my doctor, who after a series of tests, confirms what many seasoned runners might guess: my calves, hamstrings and glutes need strengthening. He refers me to a physical therapist for targeted strength exercises: planks, bridges, stretches, superman-poses, lunges, squats, the list goes on.

The plot thickens after my PT advises a visit to a podiatrist. A thorough examination reveals my off-the-charts wide feet and high arches, an 'aha' moment that explains lifelong struggles with footwear and certain activities like ice skating and skiing. Or even the simple inability to find shoes that don't bust open after a few months.  
To address this, I receive custom insoles for better foot support.

To my surprise, I also learn that my beloved Brooks are actually making things worse rather than helping. It's back to the drawing board for new running shoes - a quest that still remains unsolved to this day...

## A New Tempo in My Runs
Right around when I was figuring out the whole shoe puzzle and muscle mechanics, I dived into some running-themed reads. Fiction like [Once a Runner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6949301-once-a-runner) and Haruki Murakami's reflections on running kept my spirits high and my feet moving. But the real game-changer? [Born to Run (Christopher McDougall)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7986569-born-to-run).

The story of the [Tarahumara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rar%C3%A1muri) tribe in Mexico blew my mind. It wasn't just their endurance that got me; it was [their approach to running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot_running) – the idea that less is more when it comes to our feet. This book turned my understanding of running on its head. Cushioned soles, thick heel padding – it all encourages us to take longer strides and land on our heels, which, as it turns out, is pretty rough on our knees and hips.

So, what did I take away from all this? Shorter strides are the way to go. Less impact, less strain. Plus, when you land on your forefoot, your ankle acts like an extra spring, cushioning each step. It’s all about reducing that jarring impact.

As an experiment, I started orchestrating my runs to the pulse of music, each step in harmony with a specific beat. Smaller, quicker steps, all to the specific tempo of a tune, gradually bumping up the beats-per-minute with every week. It made a world of difference; I’ll dive into this melodic journey in an upcoming post.

## Things I Learned

- **Get the right shoes:** Especially for someone with unique feet like mine, choosing the right running shoes is crucial.
- **Do your strength training:** Strength exercises aren't just beneficial; they're essential for a well-rounded running routine.
- **Technique matters:** How you run can mean the difference between injury and safe, enjoyable runs. Running isn’t about speed; it's about sustainability.
