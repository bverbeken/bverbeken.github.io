Hi there. 

So, I'm finally starting a blog. "Just" do it, right? 

Well, no. Actually, I'm re-starting a blog. For the fourth or fifth time, not sure. I've been going back and 
forth a couple of times already in the past, but it seems one does not "just" start blogging. \
Let alone make a habit out of it. 

In this first post, I want to get the common questions out of the way.  
Let's get this started, shall we? 

### Who is this for? 
Me, mainly. I see it as a personal self-improvement experiment, to finally start writing, and to see where this will take me. \
Boring stuff, really. Sorry, not sorry.

### What will you write about?  
In my humble experience, nothing is ever "just" anything. Which is why I put quotes around the word "just", whether 
in characters when writing or with hand quotes when verbally uttering words. Can't help it, it's one of my quirks.
And it's contagious too, ask my teammates.

Quotes around "just" have a number of cool side effects. 

For one, once you start seeing things as not "just" anything, you open yourself up to be amazed by anything. 
You discover that nothing is ordinary, that ordinary people do extraordinary things, and that nothing comes for free.  

Next, it makes you feel good when you actually accomplish something - anything. \ 
Because when nothing is "just" anything, neither is that thing you just did! 

And one more: consistently using quotes for the word "just" is an awesome guard against hubris (ὕβρις, love that word!).  

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Stay tuned.  

### No, seriously. What will you write about? 
Well, that ☝️, applied to examples from the context of my petty little life, both personal and professional.

So expect topics like being a parent, software development, running a small business, reading, running, ... Tabletop RPG's perhaps?  

Oh and maybe a dash of music, in particular the vocal kind.    

### Who are you anyway?
I'm "just" [Ben](/about/), a software developer, singer, father, runner, reader, nerd, and that's in no particular order. 

### When is your book coming out? 
Lol, I'm not trying to sell anything. Not here anyways.
