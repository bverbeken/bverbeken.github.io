&lt;p>Losers is a series of single-story documentaries about people who &amp;ldquo;failed&amp;rdquo; in sports, sometimes in pretty spectacular ways. This particular episode was called &lt;em>Lost in the Desert&lt;/em>. It was the story of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauro_Prosperi">Mauro Prosperi&lt;/a>, a former Olympic athlete who met a sandstorm and (spoiler alert) nearly died in the desert of Morocco, during the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_des_Sables">Marathon des Sables&lt;/a>(1994).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you care about visuals, this documentary is honestly not worth your time. Most of it you&amp;rsquo;ll be spending watching either cartoons (srsly), interviews or stock footage of deserts. And the story is not exceptional either. I mean, I pretty much told you everything already, with the exception of some bat-eating and the really lucky rescue, in true deus-ex-machina fashion (ok I won&amp;rsquo;t spoil &lt;em>everything&lt;/em>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, the thing that triggered me was something the ex-wife, as the main narrator of the story, said early in the episode:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[Starting a family] should change life&amp;rsquo;s priorities. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t love sports or running anymore.
Instead, it means fitting it into a &lt;em>puzzle&lt;/em> that includes other pieces as well.
Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s selfishness, that&amp;rsquo;s not malicious, but it can only be called selfishness.
To think that one&amp;rsquo;s passion comes before everyone else &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s selfishness.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This notion of selfishness in pursuing personal passions got me thinking about how it applies to my own life, especially as a parent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Life often feels like a giant puzzle: you not only have to juggle your own life, but that of your kids too. And the more kids you have, the more balls you&amp;rsquo;ve got to keep in the air. Sure, there&amp;rsquo;s a bit of &amp;rsquo;economical juggle-nomics&amp;rsquo; involved - the more kids, the less each &amp;ldquo;life-ball&amp;rdquo; extra seems to weigh in the daily circus. And thankfully, it&amp;rsquo;s usually a tag-team act, not a solo performance.
But still.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that puzzle, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to convince yourself that &amp;lsquo;missing this training isn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal,&amp;rsquo; or that &amp;lsquo;skipping this run is okay compared to the kids&amp;rsquo; needs.&amp;rsquo; Just to be clear, I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about taking the lazy option and watch TV instead of going out for a run! What I mean is that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say &amp;ldquo;my training is important, and more important than [fill in kids duty here]&amp;rdquo;, so I do need to prioritise that run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And why is that hard? Because it &lt;em>feels selfish&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But is it, really?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been curious about how professional athletes navigate these choppy waters of family and personal ambition. Imagine the scene: a dedicated athlete telling their partner, &amp;ldquo;Honey, I can&amp;rsquo;t handle the grocery run today, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a tough interval training lined up.&amp;rdquo; Or perhaps, even more boldly, &amp;ldquo;Could you tackle the dishes tonight? I can&amp;rsquo;t, need to rest, coach&amp;rsquo;s orders.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And those are professional athletes, which means they can use the handy argument that it&amp;rsquo;s their actual &lt;em>job&lt;/em>. But what about the semi-pros, the weekend warriors? Their challenge is arguably even greater. So, how do they, and by extension we, strike this delicate balance?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer, of course, is simple: it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to have a good understanding with your partner and kids. Everyone must acknowledge that the pursuit of personal passions, like training, isn&amp;rsquo;t just a selfish whim; it&amp;rsquo;s something that enriches you, making you a better partner, parent, and person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, is balancing personal ambitions with family life a selfish act?
Perhaps not entirely. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s only sometimes, maybe, a tiny bit selfish. And that&amp;rsquo;s ok.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And with that thought, it&amp;rsquo;s time to lace up my running shoes. But this time I&amp;rsquo;ll start my warmup with a simple &amp;ldquo;Thank you&amp;rdquo; to my family. Because, at the end of the day, their support is what keeps me running â€“ both literally and metaphorically.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trip to Another One Bites The Dust</title><link>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/07/another-one-bites-the-dust/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 00:22:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bverbeken.github.io/posts/2022/07/another-one-bites-the-dust/</guid><description>&lt;p>Woke up early this morning. Not that that&amp;rsquo;s particularly unusual, but today was with a good reason: I&amp;rsquo;d promised my son to take him for a bike ride.
You see, he&amp;rsquo;s quite an active little fella who needs his daily dose of physical activity. And I&amp;rsquo;m happy to fix him up :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve always found that actually &lt;em>going somewhere&lt;/em> is much more interesting than &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; going for a ride.
It feels a lot less like training that way, haha.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead of riding around in a circle, I took my son to go see &lt;a href="https://www.anotheronebitesthedust.be/">Another One Bites The Dust&lt;/a> (AOBtD), an ultra race that was - and, at the time of writing, is still - being held in Bierbeek.
That&amp;rsquo;s at some 20 km from where we live, aka the perfect distance for a saturday morning round trip.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ultra-what" >Ultra what?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#ultra-what">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>According to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramarathon">Wikipedia&lt;/a>, an ultra running race is &amp;ldquo;any footrace longer than traditional marathon length of 42.195 km&amp;rdquo;.
Some races run over a certain distance (e.g. 50km, 100km, 100 miles), and others last for a predetermined time (e.g. 24 hour runs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Backyard / One More Loop type races are different: there is no predefined finish, either in distance nor time.
Instead, participants run a short loop (typically 6.7 km or 4.167 miles, to make for 100 miles in 24 hours) once every hour.
The last one standing wins, the others get DNF behind their names.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say it takes a special kind of special to even consider signing up for such a race.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fun fact: earlier, in May, a Belgian, Merijn Geerts, set a new world record: he ran 90 loops of 6.7km in Rettert, Germany.
That&amp;rsquo;s 603.5 km (!).
In almost 4 days (!!).
Without actual real sleep, other than the occasional 5-minute nap in between loops (!!!!ðŸ˜³)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other fun fact: that same Merijn Geerts won the past three editions of AOBtD.&lt;/p>

&lt;br>
So off we went on our bikes, to go superhero-spotting in Bierbeek. We arrived on the scene at around 10:35.
Just in time to see the runners returning from their 15th loop of 5.959 km, meaning they had just started their 3rd marathon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Atypical runners in an atypical race&lt;/strong> &lt;br>
I had expected to see sharp-as-a-knife athletes, well-equipped and looking serious and seriously tired.
And there were some of those, but they were definitely not the majority.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, most were walking, chatting and smiling (!). Some wore a backpack, others what looked like shorts you&amp;rsquo;d wear to the beach.
I saw only one runner with poles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And there were no bib numbers to be seen, they wore removable ankle bracelets for time registration instead.
I guess that makes changing shirts a lot more practical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br>
&lt;strong>friendly &amp;amp; no-nonsense&lt;/strong> &lt;br>
My son and I were welcomed by a friendly lady, who explained that there was no entry fee. They did have an &lt;em>honesty box&lt;/em> though, so we put in some
money and were told we could help ourselves to some drinks or food.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think we were the only actual supporters; the rest of the people were runners, their crew, or the race crew. But we didn&amp;rsquo;t feel out of place or unwelcome at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Not much going on, but so much to see&lt;/strong> &lt;br>
The summer heat was coming up, I heard distant screaming from kids on a bouncy castle. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember any music though.
A smoldering camp fire filled the air with the scent of summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We just sat down, had a drink and watched runners coming in. At ten to eleven, when the next loop would start, someone shouted &amp;ldquo;Ten Minutes!&amp;rdquo;. Then nothing for five minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At five to eleven (&amp;ldquo;Five Minutes!&amp;rdquo;) people started gathering at the gate, then progressively more as the start of the next hour and so the next loop approached.
Some runners were still coming in and didn&amp;rsquo;t even take the time to sit down.
Others took a chair to the start to sit and take naps until the last second, or were nibbling away a pack of salty crackers or candy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, 11 o&amp;rsquo;clock came, someone blew a horn, everyone clapped, the runners ran - or walked - through the gate, and the campsite was calm and peaceful once more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../another-one-bites-the-dust/2.jpeg" alt="the campsite">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br>
We headed back to our bikes, and rode back home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Did this make an everlasting impression on my son? Probably not.&lt;br>
But at least it was a chance for him to see that ordinary looking people are capable of extraordinary feats ðŸ’ª, and we got a good morning ride out of it too!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
